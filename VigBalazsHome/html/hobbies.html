    <dt>Cycling</dt>
    <dd> Bicycles provide numerous benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails.
        Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, and much reduced traffic congestion.
        These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required).
        By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.</dd>
    <dt>Hiking</dt>
    <dd class="nonindexed"> Hiking sometimes involves bushwhacking and is sometimes referred to as such.
        This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest, undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress requires pushing vegetation aside.
        In extreme cases of bushwhacking, where the vegetation is so dense that human passage is impeded, a machete is used to clear a pathway.</dd>
